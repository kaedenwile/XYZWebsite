                    This is the personal website of Kaeden Wile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before graduating from the University of Washington with a degree in computer
                    science and a minor in mathematics, I spent 2 years working Integris, a privacy automation
                    and regulation startup, which has since been bought by OneTrust Software.
                    Today, I'm a Software Development Engineer at AWS working for the Storage Gateway infrastructure
                    team. Since my first Python programming book back in junior high, I've tried my hand at everything
                    from apps and games to websites and APIs and even some machine learning. I'm an Apple fanboy, a
                    software polyglot, and an aspiring entrepreneur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, my passions include faith, family, and music. My faith is central to how I live
                    life and see the world around me. As a Christian, I believe that Jesus is Lord, that the Bible is
                    the Word of God, and that I am called to love those around me. I'm extremely close with my family
                    and enjoy spending time with them. I love singing, playing guitar, and writing music.
                </p>
